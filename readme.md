# FrostWing Operating System

Welcome to FrostWing, a lightweight and flexible operating system designed for x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64) architectures. This README will guide you through the process of building and running FrostWing, along with an overview of its features and architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start building FrostWing, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Latest Version of [Limine Bootloader](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine.git --branch=v5.x-branch-binary --depth=1
```
- Compile the Limine bootloader
```bash
make -C limine
```
- A suitable cross-compiler for your target architecture (x86_64, ARM64, or RISC-V).
- QEMU System Emulator

### Building FrostWing

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradosh-arduino/FrostWing
    ```
2. **Change into the FrostWing directory:**
    ```bash
    cd FrostWing
    ```
3. **Build FrostWing for your target architecture:**
- For x86_64:
    ```bash
    make -C source
    make
    ```
- For aarch64 (ARM64):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="aarch64"
    make
    ```
- For riscv64 (RISC-V):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="riscv64"
    make
    ```
4. (Optional - Recommened) To use custom cross compiler:
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="ARCH" CC="cc"
    make
    ```

### Building the FrostWing Doxygen documentation

If you want to have the doxygen documentation (for some reason), it's enough to just run
```bash
doxygen
```
inside the repository folder. A directory called `docs` will be created which should contain the generated html documentation.
The main html file is located at: `docs/html/index.html`

### Running FrostWing

After building FrostWing, you can run it using a virtual machine or on real hardware. The specific steps for running it will depend on your chosen target architecture. Read the main Markdown to run FrostWing.

### Booting to real machine
This process is in pending and we have not tried it yet.

## Features

- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability.
- Support for multiple target architectures: x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64).
- Simple and clean codebase with documentation.
