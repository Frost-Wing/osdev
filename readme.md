# FrostWing Operating System

Welcome to FrostWing, a lightweight and flexible operating system designed for x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64) architectures. This README will guide you through the process of building and running FrostWing, along with an overview of its features and architecture.

### Getting started
[*Please refer wiki for steps for compiling**](https://github.com/Frost-Wing/osdev/wiki)

### Hardware/Software (Emulator) Requirements
#### Minimum Requirements (BIOS)
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 75 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Only Framebuffer.

#### Minimum Requirements (UEFI)
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 170 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Only Framebuffer.

#### Recommended Requirements (BIOS)
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 128 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Integrated Graphics

#### Recommended Requirements (UEFI)
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 256 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Integrated Graphics

### Booting to real machine
This operating system is real machine **bootable** and tested under the following circumstances:

Boot Disk information:
- Using 32 GB Pendrive
- GPT Disk (MBR Also works)
- Both BIOS / UEFI supported
- Ventoy loaded
- FrostWing.iso in the root directory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to use Ventoy because you will not have the risk of flashing and failing of USB-Drives
