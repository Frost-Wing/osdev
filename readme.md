# FrostWing Operating System

Welcome to FrostWing, a lightweight and flexible operating system designed for x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64) architectures. This README will guide you through the process of building and running FrostWing, along with an overview of its features and architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start building FrostWing, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Latest Version of [Limine Bootloader](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine.git --branch=v5.x-branch-binary --depth=1
```
- Compile the Limine bootloader
```bash
make -C limine
```
> [!NOTE]
> A suitable cross-compiler for your target architecture (x86_64, ARM64, or RISC-V) is always recommended but the os is never tested with a cross-compiler and therefore it is optional

- QEMU System Emulator

### Building FrostWing

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradosh-arduino/FrostWing
    ```
2. **Change into the FrostWing directory:**
    ```bash
    cd FrostWing
    ```
3. **Build FrostWing for your target architecture:**
- For x86_64:
    ```bash
    make -C source
    make
    ```
- For aarch64 (ARM64):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="aarch64"
    make
    ```
- For riscv64 (RISC-V):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="riscv64"
    make
    ```
4. (Optional - Recommened) To use custom cross compiler:
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="xx" CC="cc"
    make
    ```

### Building the FrostWing Doxygen documentation
> [!NOTE]
> Slower Method below

If you want to have the doxygen documentation (for some reason), it's enough to just run
```bash
 doxygen
```
inside the repository folder. A directory called `docs` will be created which should contain the generated html documentation.
The main html file is located at: `docs/html/index.html`

> [!NOTE]
> Better Method below

Visit [Doxygen Documentation for FrostWing](https://frost-wing.github.io/doxygen-docs/) for pre-compiled documentations
### Hardware/Software (Emulator) Requirements
#### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 75 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Only Framebuffer.

#### Recommended Requirements
- **CPU** Currently any x86_64 proccessor
- **RAM** 128 MB
- **Storage** Nothing required yet.
- **Graphics** Integrated Graphics

### Running FrostWing

After building FrostWing, you can run it using a virtual machine or on real hardware. The specific steps for running it will depend on your chosen target architecture. Read the main Markdown to run FrostWing.

### Booting to real machine
This operating system is real machine **bootable** and tested under the following circumstances:

Boot Disk information:
- Using 32 GB Pendrive
- GPT Disk (MBR Also works)
- Both BIOS / UEFI supported
- Ventoy loaded
- FrostWing.iso in the root directory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to use Ventoy because you will not have the risk of flashing and failing of USB-Drives
## Features

- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability.
- Support for multiple target architectures: x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64).
- Simple and clean codebase with documentation.
