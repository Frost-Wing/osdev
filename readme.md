# FrostWing Operating System

Welcome to FrostWing, a lightweight and flexible operating system designed for x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64) architectures. This README will guide you through the process of building and running FrostWing, along with an overview of its features and architecture.

### Prerequisites

Before you start building FrostWing, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Create a folder named `disk_root`
- Latest Version of [Limine Bootloader](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine)
- A suitable cross-compiler for your target architecture (x86_64, ARM64, or RISC-V).
- QEMU System Emulator

### Building FrostWing

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradosh-arduino/FrostWing
    ```
2. **Change into the FrostWing directory:**
    ```bash
    cd FrostWing
    ```
3. **Build FrostWing for your target architecture:**
- For x86_64:
    ```bash
    make -C source
    make
    ```
- For aarch64 (ARM64):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="aarch64"
    make
    ```
- For riscv64 (RISC-V):
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="riscv64"
    make
    ```
4. (Optional - Recommened) To use custom cross compiler:
    ```bash
    make -C source ARCH="ARCH" CC="cc"
    make
    ```

### Running FrostWing

After building FrostWing, you can run it using a virtual machine or on real hardware. The specific steps for running it will depend on your chosen target architecture. Read the main Markdown to run FrostWing.

### Booting to real machine
This process is in pending and we have not tried it yet.

## Features

- Multiboot-compliant, making it compatible with a wide range of bootloaders, including Limine.
- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability.
- Support for multiple target architectures: x86_64, ARM64 (aarch64), and RISC-V (riscv64).
- Simple and clean codebase with documentation.
